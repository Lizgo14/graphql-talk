Code for the application we build in my GraphQL API talk.


Liz Notes
GraphQL Notes
-declaritive query language and runtime for executing said queries that uses a type-stem that you define for your data
-query language for your API
-does not care where your data is stored
-NOT REST API


How does it work?
-POST requests, body of POST request will contain a query
-GraphQL API

Benefits
-takes all the data sources and puts them into one graph (node/edges) -more slexible
-one endpoint for your API (good for security)
-can pull data from many sources
-client gets to choose what data it recieves
-self documenting via the schema
